>
> **Training**: We manage the professional development catalog. We track who is enrolled in which course and their completion status. This ensures our staff is constantly upgrading their skills."

>
> **Step 2: The Approval Chain**: [Click 'Submit'] When I submit this, it locks the record and changes the status to 'Submitted'.
>
